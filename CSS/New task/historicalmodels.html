            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;" >The Richard Mille RM UP-01 Ferrari is one of the most extreme timepieces ever created, representing a fusion of cutting-edge watchmaking and Ferrari’s engineering spirit.

The RM UP-01 Ferrari was introduced in 2022 as a collaboration between Richard Mille and Ferrari, and it immediately drew worldwide attention because of its ultra-thin case. Measuring only 1.75 mm thick, it became the world’s thinnest mechanical watch at the time of release, beating previous records from brands like Bulgari. Despite its radical slimness, Richard Mille ensured that the watch maintained both robustness and performance, which is a hallmark of the brand.</p>
