        <p>The film is set in the fictional crime-ridden town of Kotha, near the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. The story revolves around two childhood friends, Raju (Dulquer Salmaan) and Kannan (Shabeer Kallarakkal), who become gangsters and control Kotha. Raju, the original "King of Kotha", is against drug dealing, while Kannan, after a betrayal, embraces the drug trade, leading to a rift between the two and a power struggle in the town. An incident leads to Raju's sabbatical, and after ten years, Kotha calls for his return. An inspector named Shahul Hassan (Prasanna) arrives in the town and learns about Kannan's drug dealings, and in an effort to combat Kannan's reign and seek revenge for his humiliation, he plots the return of Raju. </p>
