7. A clock shows 3:15. What is the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand?




Answer:


1)  2,6,12,20,30,42;          3) 2x^2 = 128;
                                 x^2 = 64;
2)  3x+12/6=10;                  x= 8 
    3x+12=60
    3x=48;
    x=16;

4)  3x+6/5x-4=2/3
    9x+18 = 10x-8
    10x-9x=18+8
    x=26

   boys= 3x= 78
   girls= 5x = 130

5) 12 days and 18 days
   
   one day
   
   1/12 + 1/18 = 5/36
   
   4 days
  
   4 * 5/36 = 5/9   --  its complete works 

   pending works

  1- 5/9  =  4/9

7)  | (30 * h) - (11/2 * m) |
    | 30 * 3 - 11 * 7.5 |
