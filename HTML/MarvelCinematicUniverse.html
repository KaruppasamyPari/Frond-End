            <h1>1. IRON MAN</h1>
            <img src="Marvel/1.jpg">
            <p> Iron Man is the superhero identity of Tony Stark, a genius billionaire, inventor, and CEO 
                of Stark Industries. In the first Iron Man movie (2008), Tony is living a lavish, 
                carefree life selling advanced weapons until he is kidnapped by a terrorist group 
                called the Ten Rings while demonstrating a missile in Afghanistan. During the captivity, 
                he is gravely injured by his own weapons and kept alive by a fellow prisoner, 
                Yinsen, who implants an Arc Reactor into his chest to keep shrapnel from reaching 
                his heart. Instead of building the missile the terrorists demand, Tony secretly builds 
                a powered suit of armor and escapes. This traumatic experience opens his eyes to the harm 
                his weapons cause, and he returns home determined to shut down his weapons division.
                Back home, Tony refines his armor and becomes Iron Man, fighting those who misuse his technology, 
                including his former mentor and business partner Obadiah Stane, who becomes the villain Iron Monger. 
                Tony’s public declaration “I am Iron Man” at the end of the film marks a bold move in superhero storytelling. 
                Over the course of the MCU, Tony evolves from a self-centered inventor into a brave and selfless hero. 
                In Iron Man 2, he faces health problems due to the Arc Reactor and new threats like Whiplash. 
                In Iron Man 3, he battles PTSD after the events of The Avengers and fights a terrorist called 
                the Mandarin, later revealed to be a cover for a corporate plot.
                Tony becomes a founding member of the Avengers, contributing his resources, intelligence, 
                and armor to protect Earth. His relationships—especially with Pepper Potts, Steve Rogers 
                (Captain America), and Peter Parker (Spider-Man)—highlight his growth into a mentor and 
                father-like figure. In Avengers: Age of Ultron, his attempt to protect the world leads to 
                the creation of Ultron, a dangerous AI. This guilt shapes his support for superhero regulation 
                in Captain America: Civil War, causing a rift with Steve Rogers.

            <h1>2.THE INCREDIBLE HULK</h1> 
            <img src="Marvel/2.jpg">
            <p>
                The Incredible Hulk follows the story of Dr. Bruce Banner, a brilliant scientist who becomes 
                the victim of a failed experiment gone wrong. While working on a secret military project to
                recreate the Super Soldier Serum, Bruce is exposed to dangerous levels of gamma radiation, 
                which transforms him into a powerful green monster—the Hulk—whenever he becomes angry or stressed. 
                Fearing the destruction he causes and the harm he could bring to others, Bruce goes into hiding, 
                living a quiet life in Brazil while searching for a cure to rid himself of the Hulk.
                Meanwhile, the U.S. military, led by General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, sees the Hulk as both a 
                threat and a potential weapon. Ross sends an elite soldier, Emil Blonsky, to capture Bruce. 
                Blonsky, obsessed with power, volunteers to be injected with a variant of the serum and slowly 
                turns into an even more dangerous creature called the Abomination. Bruce eventually reunites 
                with his former lover, Betty Ross, who helps him control his transformation and understand the 
                consequences of his condition.
                In the film’s climax, the Hulk must face the Abomination in a brutal battle in Harlem. 
                Though the Hulk triumphs, Bruce realizes that he can never truly separate himself from 
                the monster inside. He chooses to control it instead of curing it. The film ends with Bruce 
                living in isolation again, but now with better control over his transformations. 
                In a post-credit scene, Tony Stark (Iron Man) appears and hints at forming a team, 
                foreshadowing the birth of the Avengers.

            <p>
                After revealing his identity as Iron Man, Tony Stark becomes a global celebrity, but faces 
                increasing pressure from the U.S. government to hand over his Iron Man suit for military use. 
                Meanwhile, Tony is secretly dying from palladium poisoning caused by the arc reactor in his chest. 
                He begins to act recklessly, passing control of Stark Industries to Pepper Potts and recruiting 
                Natalie Rushman (Black Widow in disguise).
                At the same time, Ivan Vanko, a Russian physicist whose father worked with Tony's father 
                Howard Stark, creates his own arc-reactor-powered weapon and attacks Tony at the Monaco 
                Grand Prix, seeking revenge for his father's disgrace. Though Tony defeats him, 
                Vanko is later recruited by arms dealer Justin Hammer to build drones and rival suits.
                As Tony struggles with his health and legacy, Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. steps in to help 
                him find a solution. Using his father’s old research, Tony discovers a new element that replaces 
                the toxic palladium, saving his life.
                In the final battle, Tony and his friend James Rhodes (now War Machine) fight off Hammer’s 
                drones and a powerful Vanko in a new suit. They defeat him just in time before he detonates himself.
                The movie ends with Tony and Pepper rekindling their relationship, and S.H.I.E.L.D. 
                continues evaluating him for the Avengers Initiative.

            <p>
                Thor, the Norse God of Thunder, is banished from his home in Asgard to Earth by his father Odin 
                after he recklessly reignites an ancient war. Stripped of his powers and his enchanted hammer Mjolnir, 
                Thor must learn humility and responsibility. On Earth, he meets astrophysicist Jane Foster, 
                who helps him understand the value of compassion and sacrifice.
                Meanwhile, Loki, Thor’s jealous brother, discovers his true heritage as a Frost Giant and plots 
                to take the throne of Asgard. He manipulates events to make Thor appear unworthy, while secretly 
                planning to destroy Jotunheim, the Frost Giants’ realm.
                Thor eventually proves himself worthy by sacrificing himself to save his friends from Loki’s 
                destructive plans. This act of selflessness restores his powers and allows him to wield Mjolnir again. 
                In a climactic battle in Asgard, Thor confronts Loki and stops him from destroying Jotunheim.
                The film ends with Thor reconciling with Odin and promising to protect both Asgard and Earth. 
                A post-credit scene teases the Tesseract, a powerful artifact that will play a significant role 
                in future MCU films.

            <img src="Marvel/5.jpg">
            <p>
                Set during World War II, the story follows Steve Rogers, a frail young man who desperately 
                wants to serve his country but is repeatedly rejected due to his small size and health issues. 
                His determination catches the eye of Dr. Abraham Erskine, who selects him for the Super Soldier Program. 
                Steve is injected with a special serum and transformed into the enhanced Captain America.
                After Erskine is assassinated by a Nazi agent, the project seems doomed. Initially, 
                Steve is used only as a propaganda symbol, but he soon takes matters into his own hands 
                and rescues captured soldiers, including his best friend Bucky Barnes, from enemy lines.
                The main villain, Red Skull (Johann Schmidt), head of the Nazi science division HYDRA, 
                seeks to use a powerful artifact called the Tesseract to conquer the world. 
                Captain America leads missions to dismantle HYDRA and stop Red Skull’s plans.
                In a final act of heroism, Steve crashes Red Skull’s plane—loaded with deadly 
                weapons—into the Arctic to prevent disaster, sacrificing himself. He is presumed dead but is 
                later discovered frozen and preserved decades later.
                The film ends with Steve waking up in the modern day, realizing he’s been asleep for over 70 years, 
                setting the stage for his role in The Avengers.

            <img src="Marvel/6.jpg">
            <p>
                The Avengers (2012) is the culmination of Marvel’s Phase One, where individual heroes are 
                united for the first time. The story begins when Loki arrives on Earth, stealing the Tesseract, 
                a powerful cosmic cube, and taking control of Hawkeye and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. 
                Nick Fury, recognizing the scale of the threat, reactivates the Avengers Initiative. 
                One by one, key heroes are brought together—Tony Stark (Iron Man), Steve Rogers (Captain America), 
                Bruce Banner (Hulk), Thor, Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), and eventually Clint Barton (Hawkeye) 
                after he’s freed from Loki’s control. However, assembling the team proves difficult, as clashing 
                egos and conflicting ideals create tension.
                As Loki’s plan unfolds, he seeks to bring an alien army, the Chitauri, to conquer Earth. 
                He allows himself to be captured and brought aboard the Helicarrier, where he manipulates 
                the team from within. During a surprise attack, Agent Coulson is killed, which becomes the 
                emotional turning point that pushes the Avengers to truly come together. 
                Loki opens a portal above New York City using the Tesseract, unleashing a massive alien invasion. 
                The Avengers unite on the battlefield for the first time, showcasing their teamwork and individual 
                powers. Iron Man ultimately diverts a nuclear missile into the portal, destroying the 
                Chitauri mothership and ending the invasion. The portal is closed by Black Widow using Loki's 
                scepter.
                In the aftermath, Loki is taken back to Asgard by Thor, the Tesseract is secured, and 
                the Avengers part ways—for now. The film ends with the world recognizing the Avengers as 
                its ultimate defenders, while a mid-credit scene teases a larger cosmic threat looming in 
                the shadows: Thanos.

            <p> 
                Iron Man 3 (2013) takes place after the events of The Avengers, with Tony Stark struggling with 
                anxiety and trauma from the alien invasion in New York. He becomes obsessed with building new 
                Iron Man suits to feel in control and protect those he loves, especially Pepper Potts. 
                Meanwhile, a mysterious terrorist known as the Mandarin orchestrates a series of bombings 
                across the U.S., leaving no clues behind. When one of the attacks puts Tony’s close friend 
                Happy Hogan in the hospital, Tony publicly challenges the Mandarin, which results in his home 
                being destroyed.
                Presumed dead, Tony goes off the grid to investigate the bombings. He discovers that the Mandarin 
                is a cover created by scientist Aldrich Killian, who is using a dangerous regenerative treatment 
                called Extremis to create superpowered soldiers. Killian also kidnaps Pepper and uses Extremis 
                on her, putting her life in danger.
                Without most of his suits, Tony relies on his intelligence and resourcefulness to stop Killian. 
                In the final battle, with the help of Rhodey (War Machine/Iron Patriot), Tony summons his army of 
                suits to fight Killian and his Extremis soldiers. Pepper ultimately defeats Killian after 
                surviving the Extremis transformation. Tony then destroys all his suits in a symbolic gesture 
                of moving on and undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart, no longer needing the 
                arc reactor to survive.
                The film ends with Tony narrating that even without the suit, he will always be Iron Man.

                Thor: The Dark World (2013) follows the aftermath of Thor’s victory in The Avengers. 
                The film introduces the Aether, a powerful dark matter that threatens to destroy the universe. 
                The Dark Elves, led by Malekith, seek to use the Aether to plunge the universe into darkness.
                After Jane Foster accidentally becomes the host for the Aether, Thor must team up with her 
                and his mischievous brother Loki to stop Malekith. The story explores themes of sacrifice, 
                love, and family as Thor learns to trust Loki despite their troubled past.
                The climax takes place in London, where Thor and Loki devise a plan to use the convergence of 
                the Nine Realms to their advantage. They engage in a fierce battle against Malekith and his forces.
                In the end, Thor defeats Malekith by using Mjolnir to send him into a collapsing portal. 
                However, Loki seemingly sacrifices himself to save Thor, leaving his fate uncertain.
                The film concludes with Thor returning to Asgard and deciding not to take the throne, 
                instead choosing to protect Earth alongside Jane Foster. A post-credit scene teases the 
                Collector, hinting at future cosmic threats in the MCU.

                Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) follows Steve Rogers as he tries to adjust to 
                
                modern life while working with S.H.I.E.L.D. When a covert mission reveals a hidden conspiracy, 
                Steve begins to question who he can trust. After Nick Fury is attacked and apparently killed, 
                Steve teams up with Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) and new ally Sam Wilson (Falcon) to uncover 
                the truth. They discover that HYDRA, thought to be destroyed after World War II, has been secretly 
                operating within S.H.I.E.L.D. for decades.
                HYDRA’s plan is to launch Project Insight, a program that uses advanced helicarriers to eliminate 
                potential threats before they act. Standing in their way is a mysterious assassin known as the 
                Winter Soldier, who turns out to be Bucky Barnes, Steve’s best friend who was presumed dead and 
                has been brainwashed by HYDRA.
                Captain America refuses to fight his friend and tries to reach the real Bucky within. 
                With help from Natasha and Sam, Steve exposes HYDRA’s infiltration, bringing down S.H.I.E.L.D. 
                from within and stopping Project Insight. In the end, Bucky begins to remember who he was, and 
                Steve sets out to find and help him. The film ends with a shattered S.H.I.E.L.D. and Steve Rogers 
                questioning everything he once believed in.

                Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) introduces a ragtag group of intergalactic misfits who come 
                together to save the universe. The story begins with Peter Quill, a human abducted as a child 
                and raised by space pirates known as the Ravagers. He becomes a notorious thief, stealing a 
                mysterious orb that is sought after by the villainous Ronan the Accuser.
                After stealing the orb, Peter is pursued by Ronan and his enforcer Gamora, who has her own 
                agenda against Ronan. In a twist of fate, they are captured by bounty hunters Rocket 
                (a genetically modified raccoon) and Groot (a sentient tree). The four form an uneasy alliance

                However, they soon discover that the orb contains one of the Infinity Stones, powerful artifacts 
                that can destroy entire planets. Realizing the danger it poses in Ronan’s hands, they decide to 
                protect it instead. Along the way, they learn to trust each other and become a family-like team.
                The Guardians face off against Ronan and his forces in a climactic battle on the planet Xandar.

                Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) sees the Avengers reuniting to retrieve Loki’s scepter, which 
                contains an artificial intelligence. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner use the scepter to create Ultron,
                a peacekeeping AI that quickly becomes sentient and decides that humanity is the greatest threat to peace. 
                Ultron attacks the Avengers, leading to a series of battles across the globe.
                The team discovers that Ultron plans to use a vibranium core to create a new body for himself,
                 which they manage to stop. However, Ultron’s plan escalates as he attempts to lift a city into the 
                 sky and crash it into Earth, causing global extinction.
                The Avengers must work together with new allies Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver,

            <p>
                Ant-Man (2015) tells the story of Scott Lang, a skilled but down-on-his-luck thief who is trying to 
                go straight and reconnect with his young daughter after being released from prison. He is recruited 
                by Dr. Hank Pym, a brilliant scientist and the original Ant-Man, to steal back powerful technology 
                from his former protégé, Darren Cross. Cross has replicated Pym’s shrinking technology and created 
                a weaponized suit called the Yellowjacket, which he plans to sell to the highest bidder, including 
                dangerous organizations like HYDRA.
                Hank trains Scott to use the Ant-Man suit, which allows him to shrink in size while increasing his 
                strength and communicate with ants. With help from Hank’s daughter, Hope van Dyne, and a team of 
                quirky friends, Scott learns to become a hero. The mission becomes a race against time as Cross 
                prepares to unleash the Yellowjacket suit to the world.
                In a final battle inside a child’s bedroom, Scott defeats Cross by shrinking down to the 
                quantum realm, a mysterious subatomic space. He survives the trip and returns, proving it’s 
                possible to come back from the quantum realm—something thought impossible. Hank realizes there 
                may still be hope to find his long-lost wife, Janet van Dyne.
                The film ends with Scott getting closer to his daughter, earning redemption, and Hope being 
                offered her own superhero role as the Wasp. A post-credit scene hints at Scott’s future involvement 
                with the Avengers.

    <p>
        Peter Parker goes on a school trip to Europe, hoping for a break from hero duties. Nick Fury recruits him
        to fight mysterious elemental creatures, and Peter teams up with Mysterio, a new hero with hidden motives.
        Mysterio deceives everyone, using advanced illusions and drones to appear as a savior while plotting to 
        gain control of Tony Stark’s technology. Peter struggles with the responsibility left to him by Tony and 
        the pressure of living up to Iron Man’s legacy. After discovering Mysterio’s true intentions, Peter 
        regains his confidence, defeats Mysterio in a dramatic battle in London, and embraces his role as 
        Spider-Man. The film ends with a shocking twist: Mysterio reveals Peter’s secret identity to the world, 
        turning his life upside down and setting up major consequences for the future.
        Throughout the film, Peter’s relationships are tested—he tries to confess his feelings to MJ, navigates 
        awkward moments with his best friend Ned, and faces the expectations of Nick Fury and Happy Hogan. 
        The story explores Peter’s growth as he learns to trust his instincts, use his intelligence to outsmart 
        Mysterio’s illusions, and accept that he can’t always rely on others for guidance. The action sequences 
        are visually stunning, especially the illusion battles, which challenge Peter’s perception of reality.
        The movie also delves into the global aftermath of the “Blip,” showing how society is adjusting to the 
        return of those who vanished. Peter’s journey is both personal and universal, as he grapples with loss, 
        responsibility, and the desire for a normal life. By the end, Peter emerges more mature and determined, 
        but the public exposure of his identity sets the stage for even greater challenges in the next chapter 
        of his story.

        Desperate to fix things, he seeks Doctor Strange’s help to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. 
        The spell goes wrong, breaking open the multiverse and bringing villains from other universes—Green Goblin, 
        Doc Ock, Electro, Sandman, and Lizard—into the MCU. Peter teams up with two other Spider-Men from 
        alternate realities, learning from their experiences and forming a brotherly bond. Together, they cure
