Hi, I’m Karuppasamy M from Sankarapandiyapuram. I recently graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from Karpagam College of Engineering. I’m passionate about web and mobile app development, with hands-on experience from internships in Android (Java) and React JS. My notable project is a web-based Hearing Impaired Communication System using hand gesture detection. I enjoy teamwork, learning, and taking responsibility, and I’m seeking IT job opportunities to grow professionally and personally.
