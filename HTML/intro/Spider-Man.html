    The Boy Behind the Mask
</h1>
<P>
    Once upon a time in New York City, there lived a shy, kind-hearted teenage boy named Peter Parker.<br>
    He wasn’t popular, not the strongest, and often went unnoticed. <br>
    He lived with his loving Aunt May and Uncle Ben — the only family he had left after his parents died in an accident.<br>
     Life was simple, sometimes tough, but filled with love.<br>
</P>
<h2>Peter</h2>
<p>
    Peter was smart — really smart — and had a deep love for science. <br>
    One day, while on a school trip to a science lab, something strange happened. <br>
    A genetically modified spider bit him. At first, it felt like nothing. <br>
    But soon, Peter noticed changes. He could suddenly climb walls, shoot webs, and sense danger before it happened — he was no longer the same boy.
</p><br>
<p>At first, Peter used his new powers for fun. He even tried to earn money with it. But then came a moment that would change his life forever.

One night, Peter let a criminal escape because he thought, “It’s not my problem.” But soon, that same criminal ended up killing Uncle Ben — the man who raised him. That day, Peter’s heart broke. He realized his mistake. From that pain was born a promise — a responsibility.</p>

    Peter became Spider-Man
</h2>     
<p>
    Peter became Spider-Man — not for fame, not for revenge — but to protect people, to make sure no one else lost their loved ones the way he did.
<br>
But it wasn’t easy.
<br>
By day, he was still Peter — trying to study, love, and survive teenage life. By night, he was Spider-Man — swinging through the city, saving strangers, fighting villains, and often getting hurt, misunderstood, or blamed.
<br>
He lost friends, love, and even had moments where he wanted to quit. But he never did. Why?
<br>
Because deep down, Peter Parker was never just a superhero. He was a human being — full of love, guilt, strength, and hope.
<br>
He was one of us.
